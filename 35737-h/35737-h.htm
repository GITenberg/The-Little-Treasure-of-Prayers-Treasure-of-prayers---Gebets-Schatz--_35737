<h2 id="c1">1. Sunday Morning Prayer.</h2>
<p>Eternal, almighty God and Father! I
most heartily praise and thank Thee,
that Thou hast graciously, by Thy holy angels,
preserved me from all harm and danger
both of body and soul, during the past
night and all previous time; and I most
heartily pray Thee, forgive me all my sins
wherewith I have offended Thee, and enlighten
my heart with Thy Holy Spirit,
that I may daily grow and increase in Thy
knowledge. Grant me grace also, that I
may, during this day, avoid all sin and
shame, and be found in Thy divine will,
in order that I may so walk as to be preserved
from all evil, may always and constantly
keep Thee in my heart and thoughts,
and when the time of my departure approaches,
grant that I may fall asleep in
the true knowledge of Thy dear Son Jesus
Christ, unto a blessed and eternal life.
Amen.</p>
</div>
<div id="p2" title="2. Before going to Church.">
<div class="pb" id="Page_008">[008]</div>
<h2 id="c2">2. Before going to Church.</h2>
<p>Merciful God and Father! Thou
seest, that by reason of my depraved
nature I have no delight in Thy word, and
that I so easily permit the devil, my own flesh
and blood, the children of the world, also
false teachers and preachers and other trivial
causes keep me away from it, and that I am
too indolent and careless to hear and preserve
Thy word. Therefore I now pray
Thee, O eternal God, forgive me this my
inbred indolence, and do Thou give me a
heart willing and apt to hear and meditate
upon Thy word. Awake in me such an
earnest longing that I may have a desire
after the sincere milk of the divine word,
as new-born babes. Help me, that I may
find my chief delight in Thy word. May
there be nothing in this world dearer to me
than Thy word; may I love it more than
gold and all fine gold, and always regard it
as my best treasure. And as I, alas! have
lived to see the time which Thy dear Son
Himself foretold, that false Christs should
arise and do wonders, so that, if it were
<span class="pb" id="Page_009">[009]</span>
possible, even the elect should be deceived,
I pray Thee that Thou wouldst graciously
defend and protect me from error and false
doctrine. Keep me in Thy truth, for Thy
word is truth, that I may cling to the same
as heavenly truth, and remain steadfast in
the same unto death. Grant this for the
sake of the honor of Thy most holy and
blessed name. Amen.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" title="3. Sunday Evening Prayer.">
<h2 id="c3">3. Sunday Evening Prayer.</h2>
<p>Lord, almighty God and heavenly Father,
I most heartily thank Thee for all Thy
goodness and benefits which Thou hast this
day so kindly shown unto me, in that Thou
hast defended me from evil and preserved
my health. And I, Thy dear child, further
pray Thee that Thou wouldst mercifully
keep me in Thy alone saving word to my
last breath, and enlighten my heart with
Thy Holy Spirit, that I may know what is
good or evil. And wouldst graciously wipe
out the remembrance of all the sins which
I this day have knowingly done, also of my
secret sins, and grant me this night a christian
<span class="pb" id="Page_010">[010]</span>
rest, that I may arise again refreshed
and in health, to Thy praise. Help also,
dear Father, that I may begin a new life,
well pleasing in Thy sight, to the salvation
of my soul, in Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son,
our only Helper. Amen.</p>
</div>
<div id="p4" title="4. Another Sunday Evening Prayer.">
<h2 id="c4">4. Another Sunday Evening Prayer.</h2>
<p>We adore and praise Thee, Lord God,
Father of heaven and earth, that Thou
hast so bountifully supplied us this day not
only with our daily bread to nourish the body,
but also with the heavenly food of Thy word
for our souls. Grant, O faithful God, that
it may remain in our hearts, and bring forth
much fruit to Thy honor and our salvation.
We also pray Thy fatherly goodness not to
deprive us of Thy pure word and ministry;
and that Thou wouldst not visit upon us the
sins wherewith we may have desecrated this
day, but forgive them according to Thy great
goodness, and for the sake of the bitter sufferings
and death of Thy dear Son Jesus
Christ. And finally, let us this day, and
all the remaining time of our mortal life in
<span class="pb" id="Page_011">[011]</span>
this vale of tears, be commended to Thy
fatherly blessing and divine protection; and
may Thy holy angels keep charge over us,
that the wicked one may have no power
over us.</p>
<p>But as the evening of this world is now
approaching, and the day is far spent, grant
us the grace of Thy Spirit, that we may
constantly watch, and, in living faith, ardent
love, firm hope and a holy walk and
demeanor, wait for that blessed hope, and
the glorious appearing of the great God and
our Saviour Jesus Christ, when He shall
come to judge the quick and the dead, in
order that we may then receive Him in a
worthy manner and with joy, enter with
Him into eternal life, and celebrate with all
the elect the Sabbath without end. Have
mercy, O Lord! upon Thy whole Christian
Church, and deliver Thy poor persecuted
flock from all oppression, mockery and tyranny,
comfort all anxious and troubled consciences
by the true comforter, the Holy
Spirit, and send us all Thy peace through
Jesus Christ, our Intercessor and only Mediator.
Amen.</p>

<h2 id="c5">5. Monday Morning Prayer.</h2>
<p>Holy and faithful God, heavenly Father!
I most heartily praise, honor and adore
Thee, that during the past night Thou hast
permitted me to rest and sleep in safety, and
by Thy fatherly love hast awakened me
again refreshed and in the enjoyment of
health. I most heartily pray Thee that
Thou wouldst this day also and always graciously
preserve me together with (my dear
parents, brothers and sisters, and) all true
Christians from all danger and harm both
of body and soul, in order that I may always
be found in Thy will. For I commend
myself, my body and soul, heart, sense,
mind and thoughts, all my strivings and aspirations,
all I do and all I leave undone,
my going in and coming out, my life and
death, and everything that I am and can do,

art my stay in life and in death. I will
praise Thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully
made, marvelous are Thy works, and
that my soul knoweth right well. Thou
hast covered me in my mother&rsquo;s womb; my
substance was not hid from Thee, when I
was made in secret, and curiously wrought
in the lowest parts of the earth. Thine
<span class="pb" id="Page_026">[026]</span>
eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect,
and in Thy book all my members
were written, which in continuance were
fashioned, when as yet there was none of
them. To-day I will call to my mind the
day of my birth which is the beginning both
of my temporal and spiritual life, when I
was brought unto Holy Baptism, and became
reconciled unto my God, and was
cleansed by the Water in connection with
the Word, when my sins were taken away
and the Holy Ghost bestowed upon me;
for all which I thank and praise Thee. I
praise Thee, O God, my Creator! that on
this day Thou hast brought me forth from
my mother&rsquo;s womb, although in pain and
sorrow. I thank Thee, that Thou hast
brought me to a place where Thy name is
rightfully known, Thy holy Word taught in
all purity, and that I am thus enabled,
under Thy guidance, to come unto the true
and living faith. I thank Thee, O Lord
Jesus Christ! for all the blessings, with
which Thou in loving-kindness often hast
remembered my body and soul, from the
hour of my birth until the present time, inasmuch
<span class="pb" id="Page_027">[027]</span>
as Thou didst not only nourish and
preserve my body, and in various ways protect
my temporal life through Thy holy
angels, who always behold the face of the
Father in heaven, and daily provide me
with abundant food and raiment, but, above
all things, Thou hast bestowed upon me
through Thy Word, spiritual and imperishable
gifts, and hast assured me in Holy
Baptism, the bath of Regeneration, that I
have been made a new creature and have
become the first-fruit of Christ Jesus; Thou
hast pardoned all my sins, and hast blessed
me with the gift of the Holy Ghost and
made me heir of eternal Life; and though
I have often, through the weakness of my
flesh, or wantonly, forsaken my God and
forgotten His commandments, and have
even more than seventy times seven committed
fearful sins against God in Heaven
and my fellow-men on earth, yet didst Thou
not, O Lord Jesus! enter into judgment
with Thy servant, and visit him with immediate
and well-deserved punishment. O
God, Holy Spirit! what a shameful life
have I thus far led! How often, and on
<span class="pb" id="Page_028">[028]</span>
how many occasions have I stumbled in my
Christian walk, and have become guilty of
great and atrocious sins! But Thou, O God,
Holy Ghost! hast just as often sought the
lost sheep, and hast brought me again upon
the path of rectitude, and hast sanctified,
comforted and guided me. Thou hast preserved
me in my station, and hast restrained
the devil and averted a host of bodily and
spiritual dangers in which I should have
perished long ago, if Thou hadst not stood
by me. O blessed Trinity! There is a
time to be born; do Thou graciously help
all fruit of the womb and grant, a joyful
birthday, forgiveness of sins and life eternal.
Grant that I may to-day spend my birthday,
as also all future days of my life, without
committing mortal sins, and that I may become
conscious of my humble birth and
wretchedness by nature. Do Thou bestow
upon me the blessings of health and life until
the goal is reached. Grant me patience
to endure all afflictions and sufferings. Comfort
me in all misfortunes and distress. Forgive
me daily my sins and grant that I may
thus continue firm unto my soul&rsquo;s salvation,

graciously forgive me whenever I have offended
them through childish weakness and
rashness. Do Thou preserve me from evil
society and frivolous people, and when sinners
entice me, that I may not consent nor
walk in their way with them, but that I

<p>Gracious God, faithful Father! Since
Thou hast, through Thy mercy, called
me into the holy state of matrimony to be
the mistress of a house, in which state I
can also serve and please Thee, my God, do
Thou bestow grace upon me, Thy servant,
that I may at all times sincerely fear Thee,
and trust in Thee above all things, O my
Creator and Redeemer; and that I may,
next to Thee, fear, love and honor my husband,
and desire none other besides him.
Help, that according to Thy command, my
will be in subjection to my husband, to
obey him with all readiness, and that I,
in the innermost of my heart, may ever be
adorned with a meek and quiet spirit and
many virtues, like unto the holy women of
olden times who trusted in God, being in
<span class="pb" id="Page_038">[038]</span>
subjection to their own husbands. Grant
that I may lead a chaste and pure life in
fear and humility, that I may in all godliness
and with kind and modest words restrain
and subdue the anger and ill-humor
of my husband, and be enabled to meet
him with indulgence; that I may, in meekness,
train my children and servants unto
the praise and honor of Thy holy name,
and that they may, with willing hearts,
obey me in those things which are good and
righteous before Thee. Help that I may
be a faithful helpmeet unto my husband,
that I may with care guard over the blessings
which Thou hast graciously bestowed
upon us and not squander them, but that I
may work and assist, as is becoming me in
this my calling, that I may be able to give
unto the needy and extend a helping hand
unto the poor. Protect us against unfaithful
and wicked servants, who neglect and
waste our property. Give me grace that I
may patiently bear the cross in married life,
and not so soon become discouraged or intimidated
whenever afflictions come upon
us; for our faith must be tested through
<span class="pb" id="Page_039">[039]</span>
trials and adversities. O Lord God! Into
Thy almighty power I commend myself,
my dear husband, all my children and servants,
do Thou preserve us from sin, disgrace
and all afflictions, through Jesus
Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>

itself, protect me? On whom then shall I,

<h2 class="interlude" id="c34">A brief Instruction concerning Confession and Absolution.</h2>
<p>My dear Christian, when you come to confession,
you must not be satisfied in repeating with
the mouth a prayer which you have committed
to memory, or to permit a prayer of confession
to be repeated to you by your confessor, but
you must yourself bring with you a penitent
heart, out of which your confession will then
freely flow, for to confess without a penitent
heart is mocking God, and without it no forgiveness
of sins can take place.</p>
<p>To a penitent heart in the first place belongs,
that you confess your sins and experience sorrow
and penitence on account of them. By nature
no man can know his sins, nor can he produce
penitence in his heart concerning them;
this must above all be sought of God. We men
are by nature much too blind, too indifferent,
<span class="pb" id="Page_052">[052]</span>
too inconsiderate, too selfrighteous, too much
possessed with self-love and self-interest, than
to be inclined and capable penitently and uprightly
to confess ourselves guilty of all sins.
Wherefore above all things bend your knees before
God and call upon him, that He might open
your eyes that you may thoroughly know the
multitude and greatness of your sins. Pray
with the blessed David: &ldquo;Search me, O God,
and know my heart; try me, and know my
thoughts; and see if there be any wicked way
in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.&rdquo;
Hereupon take the holy ten commandments and
make a careful examination of your whole life
in accordance with them. Then you will know
that you are a sinner. For as a man cannot see
a spot on his face without a glass, neither can
he know his sins without beholding himself in
the glass of the holy ten commandments. For
sin is every work, every word, yea, every
thought, which is against God&rsquo;s commandments;
for sin consists in the performance of
that which God has forbidden, or in the omission
of that which He has commanded to be
done. But you must not only regard the gross
external sins, but also the internal secret sins,
departures from God&rsquo;s commandments, which
have taken place in the heart through evil
thoughts and desires. If you will examine
yourself thus in constant prayer, you will discover
<span class="pb" id="Page_053">[053]</span>
that you have not feared, loved and trusted
God as He requires, that you have not so heartily
and confidently called upon God, prayed,
praised and given thanks, that you have not kept
His Word so holy, heard and learned it, as you
should have done. You will find that you have
not honored and loved your parents and superiors,
but have been disobedient and murmured
against them; you will find that you have sinned
against your neighbor in anger, hatred, revenge
and irreconcilableness, with unchaste thoughts
and desires, envy, illwill, avarice, an earthly
mind or with slanderous words, in short, you
will find that you have not so uprightly and
heartily loved your neighbor as yourself, that
much more selfishness, the seeking of your own
interests or your own honor has been the motive
to all your actions. With these and other
sins you have surely deserved the wrath of God,
temporal and eternal punishment, if God would
deal with you according to His stern righteousness.
From these sins which you perceive in
yourself you can draw the conclusion how impure
and depraved your heart is, from which
these sins flow, for as the water, so the spring,
and by the fruits we know the tree. Hence you
will come to the knowledge of original sin.</p>
<p>If you now will perceive these and other sins
in thyself, yea, if you consider, that the sins you
have committed in ignorance, are many more
<span class="pb" id="Page_054">[054]</span>
than those you know and feel in your heart,
which nevertheless the all knowing God places
in the light of His countenance, then you will
tremble in your conscience and experience sorrow
and penitence on account of them, that you
have so grievously offended your God and have
been so unthankful for His blessings.</p>
<p>The second part of confession is faith, and
indeed faith in Jesus Christ, who hath made
satisfaction for all thy sins and has also obtained
forgiveness of the same. Faith is as a
hand which appropriates the forgiveness of sins
and receives it as an unmerited gift of divine
grace. Without this faith all knowledge and
sorrow for sin is only the confession of a Cain
or a Judas, which ends in despair. But by
faith in Jesus Christ, the Saviour of all sinners,
the heart is comforted and made quiet. But
this faith you cannot produce in your own heart,
but it is the work and gift of God the Holy
Spirit. And if you experience that you are
wanting in this faith, and that you cannot believe
but desire to believe, then call upon God
for this faith, and he will give it thee.</p>
<p>Thereupon the fruits of penitence must follow.
These consist in this, that you no more knowingly
and intentionally will commit the sins
which have been forgiven you, but you much
more will hate and forsake them, and by the assistance
of the Holy Spirit contend against them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_055">[055]</div>
<p>If now you bring such a penitent heart with
you to confession, then you are able to receive
the absolution which your confessor gives you,
by virtue of which your sins are really and certainly
forgiven thee by God in heaven. Forgiveness
of sins Christ has obtained for all sinners
by his death and the shedding of His blood
and sealed it by His resurrection and commanded
it to be preached and delivered to all
the world through the Gospel. Now when the
confessor absolves thee, he does nothing else
than declare unto you the Gospel of the forgiveness
of sins; and yet this is not merely an
empty declaration, but such a one through
which forgiveness of sins is really presented
and offered to penitent sinners. As often as
you hear the words of absolution from his
mouth, do not doubt, but firmly believe that
your sins are forgiven thee before God in
heaven, as certainly as if Christ would immediately
speak from heaven: &ldquo;Be of good cheer,
my son (my daughter), thy sins be forgiven
thee,&rdquo; for He says: &ldquo;Whosoever heareth you,
heareth me, and whosesoever sins ye remit, they
are remitted unto them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I, miserable afflicted sinner, come unto
Thee, my heavenly Father, and bring
nothing with me but sin only. I can therefore
not lift up my eyes to Thy exalted and
most holy majesty, but I am ashamed, that
I have so oft offended Thee and not hearkened
unto Thy voice. Alas! there is nothing
good in me, I am conceived and born
in sins, my nature is so perverted and depraved,
that I cannot feel and experience
in me either a desire or love for virtue and
the heavenly gifts, but only for transitory
honor and joys and the inclination to all
evil. I have lived in sin from my youth
up, and yet I live in sin, as long as I have
this sinful flesh of Adam on me. But, dear
Lord, I comfort myself by Thy unbounded,
unfathomable, infinite and unspeakable
grace and mercy, which Thou hast promised
to all penitent sinners in Thy word and confirmed
by a sacred oath. I comfort myself
by the precious merit of Thy only begotten
Son, who was delivered for the sake of my
<span class="pb" id="Page_057">[057]</span>
sins and raised for my justification. O
heavenly Father, hide Thy face from my
sins and behold the face of Thy Son, who
in himself never did commit sin, nor ever
knew of sin, but through His most holy
obedience, blood and death hath made satisfaction
for all my sins and the sins of
the whole world. Receive me, O Father,
for the sake of this Saviour again into
grace, and do not permit his bitter sufferings
and death and his perfect precious
ransom, which he has paid Thee for my sins
to be lost by me, poor sinner, but that it
may strengthen me. And I will then
praise and bless Thee, here in time and
there in eternity. Amen.</p>

<div id="p35" title="35. Prayer for true Conversion.">
<h2 id="c36">35. Prayer for true Conversion.</h2>
<p>Almighty God, merciful Father!
Every day Thy voice calling me to repentance
and grace resounds in my ears, encouraging
me and all sinful souls unto conversion:
Return, thou backsliding Israel,
saith the Lord, and I will not cause mine
anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful,
<span class="pb" id="Page_058">[058]</span>
saith the Lord, and I will not keep anger
forever. Only acknowledge thine iniquity,
that thou hast transgressed against the
Lord, thy God. But alas! I am not sufficient
of myself, as of myself to convert
myself unto Thee. As little as the Ethiopian
can change his skin and as little as the
leopard can change its spots, so little can I
cease to do evil and do good by my natural
powers, inasmuch as the thoughts and intents
of my heart are inclined to evil from
my youth up continually. Has Thy grace
wrought so much in me that I have determined
that I will arise and reconcile myself
with Thee on account of my sins, and offer
unto Thee a broken and contrite heart, yet,
alas! satan, the accursed one, will cast a
thousandfold hindrances in the way. My
own sinful flesh and blood prevent me, that
the good that I will I cannot accomplish,
but remain in sin and finally be destroyed
therein. Wherefore, Abba, dear Father,
I bend and bow my knees in deep humility
before Thee, and ask for the sake of Thy infinite
mercy: convert me, O Lord, and I
shall be converted, help me, and I shall be
<span class="pb" id="Page_059">[059]</span>
helped, let Thy grace, my God, not be in
vain in me, but as Thou hast given to will,
so do Thou also give to accomplish it. Destroy
the wantonness of the infernal villain,
prevent the suggestions of my perverted
heart, that my holy resolution may not be
hindered or entirely destroyed. Open my
eyes that I may heartily know, painfully
lament, and bitterly bewail my sins. Give
me a divine sorrow over my transgressions,
which will bring repentance unto salvation,
which may never be repented of. Do Thou
not, O Lord, permit me to be destroyed
under the burden of sin, nor to despair with
Cain and Judas, but do Thou turn to me,
and be merciful unto me, behold my misery
and affliction, and forgive all my sins. Show
me Thy dear and merciful heart, Father,
which desireth not the death of a sinner,
but that he may be converted and live;
speak gently to my soul, and say that mercy
shall go for justice, and that Thou wilt no
more remember my transgressions. Show
me with the finger of Thy divine grace
unto Jesus, the crucified one, how he died
for my sins and rose again for my justification.
<span class="pb" id="Page_060">[060]</span>
Open to me for a refuge his bloody
wounds, in which so many poor sinners have
found comfort and salvation. Create also
a clean heart within me and renew a right
spirit within me; cast me not away from
Thy countenance and take not Thy Holy
Spirit from me; comfort me again with Thy
help, and the joyful Spirit preserve me in a
firm resolution to amend my sinful life, and

<h2 id="c37">36. Prayer for the Forgiveness of Sin.</h2>
<p>Eternal, merciful God, I, a poor miserable
afflicted sinner, come before Thy
divine Majesty bringing unto Thee nothing
but sin, and on account of this sin I dare
not raise my eyes unto Thee, but am cast
down with shame, that I have so often and
with great and manifold sins offended Thee,
my God, my Creator and Father, so that
<span class="pb" id="Page_061">[061]</span>
if Thou wouldst deal with me according to
my just dues, I would forever remain a
child of wrath and eternal damnation. But
dear Lord God and Father, I comfort myself
with Thy great mercy, with Thy unmeasurable,
unfathomable, endless and unspeakable
grace, which Thou thyself hast
vouchsafed unto me and which Thou, with
a precious oath and affirmation, hast confirmed
and given me ample assurance with
Thy Words: &ldquo;As true as I live, I have no
pleasure in the death of a sinner, but that
he might turn from his wickedness and
live.&rdquo; I comfort myself with Thine only
begotten Son, my dear Redeemer, Justifier,
Mediator and Saviour, that He has, by His
perfect obedience, sufferings and death, obtained
for me again Thy favor, and has given
unto me, one that believes in Him, power
to become Thy child and to remain an heir
of Thy boundless mercy now and in eternity.
Therefore, I will not despair, but will confess
my sins, both internal and external,
secret and manifest, unto Thee, and I will
present myself before Thee guilty as an evil-doer
and malefactor, and I know nothing
<span class="pb" id="Page_062">[062]</span>
more to do than to come upon the promise
of Thy Word with an humble heart and
dauntless spirit in true faith and sincere
confidence in Thy promised mercy and the
bitter sufferings of Thy dear Son, to the
throne of grace, and from the depths of my
heart exclaim: Abba, dear Father, Lord!
have mercy upon me! O God, be gracious
unto me, a poor, miserable sinner; forgive
all my original and actual sins, and all that
I have at any time thought, spoken or done
against Thee, consciously or unconsciously.
Lord, there is nothing good in me. In sin
was I conceived and born, in sin have I
lived, in sin do I yet live, so long as I carry
with me this sinful flesh and blood, and my
sins are continually before Thee. Thou
seest in me a thousand times more, yea, and
a thousand times greater sin than I myself
am able to see, know and feel. O Lord,
enter not into judgment with Thy servant,
for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.
Have mercy upon me for the sake
of Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son, my Lord and
Saviour, and through Thy great mercy,
which is greater than the sins of all men,
<span class="pb" id="Page_063">[063]</span>
blot out my transgressions. Wash me clean
with hyssop and sprinkle me with the pure
blood of Thy Son, which was shed upon the
cross. May I be and remain Thy child and
heir, a vessel of Thy mercy, a fountain and
dwelling of the Holy Spirit. O, Lord, redeem,
comfort and quicken me! Grant unto
me Thy grace anew! Gladden my distressed
spirit and my troubled and broken
heart with Thy holy, joyful and life-giving
Spirit. The broken reed and smoking flax
Thou wilt not, O Lord, bruise and quench.
Thou wilt not cast me away from Thy countenance
forever, this I know full well. Thou
wilt not permit me to despair, but wilt favor
me with Thy true Spirit, who will enkindle
and confirm in me true faith and comfort.
O, Lord! my God and Father, Thou faithful
God, hear my prayer, that I may continue
to be and remain Thy child and temple,
now and eternally. Permit me not to fall
into error and vice against my conscience.
Save me from blood guiltiness and from all
evil. May I ever rejoice in Thy Word, that
I may willingly hear the same, read and
ponder over it and that I may therewith
<span class="pb" id="Page_064">[064]</span>
serve and benefit others, that I may speak
of it day and night, and proclaim Thy
righteousness and glory continually; and I
will love, adore, praise, thank and serve
Thee, my God and Lord, and Thy dear Son,
my Saviour Jesus Christ, together with the
Holy Ghost, now and in all eternity with all
angels and men. Amen.</p>

<h2 id="c38">37. Prayer for Reconciliation with our Neighbor.</h2>
<p>Gracious Jesus, through Thy grace
I have prepared myself and am about
to seek the forgiveness of my sins in private
confession; but I remember, that Thou hast
said and earnestly commanded: if thou
bring thy gift before the altar and there
rememberest that thy brother hath aught
against thee: leave there thy gift before the
altar and go thy way, first be reconciled to
thy brother and then come and offer thy
gift. Now I have unfortunately fallen into
misunderstanding and variance with my
neighbor, hence do Thou so bestow upon me
Thy grace and so overrule my heart, that I
<span class="pb" id="Page_065">[065]</span>
may be willing to be reconciled with him.
I acknowledge the hardness of my heart and
confess that it is hard for me to subdue my
flesh and blood and to banish all anger and
revenge. But it is my hope, yea, my
prayer, that Thou, Lord, wilt take away
my stony heart and grant unto me a heart
of flesh, that is: a loving, reconciled heart,
and cause me to love my enemy, to bless
him that curses me, to do good unto those,
that hate me, and to pray for those who
despitefully abuse and persecute me. O!
may I meditate upon that judgment and
that terrible account which I must give
unto Thee, that I may renounce that enmity
which designs death and destruction,
and according to Thy commandment become
reconciled with my adversary whilst I am
in the way with him, and never more permit
the sun to go down upon my wrath.
And as I, in Thy name, pardon and forgive
all those, who have offended me, so let me
find all those, whom I have grieved and irritated,
ready with a willing heart, to pardon
and forgive my offences against them. O,
Jesus! forgive all our sins, and govern our
<span class="pb" id="Page_066">[066]</span>
hearts, that we may live with each other
in a christian and peaceful manner and that
we may praise Thy name here in time, until
in heaven we shall glorify Thee forever.
Amen.</p>
<h2 class="interlude" id="c39">Brief Instruction concerning the Holy Supper.</h2>
<p>Why do you desire to go to the Holy Supper?
This question each one should lay before his
conscience before he approaches the Lord&rsquo;s
table. For there are not a few who are either
altogether obtuse and thoughtless, or they come
to the Holy Supper with an entirely wrong
intention. Some will go from mere custom,
others because they are admonished to do so
by their parents, others because they consider
the partaking of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper a work of
merit, and still others because they wish to acquire
and preserve the appearance and name of
pious Christians before men. It is no wonder
that such partakers of the Holy Supper receive
no blessings from it, and that they become the
more wicked, the longer they so continue.</p>
<p>A communicant who desires to receive the
Holy Supper unto his salvation, must, in the first
place, clearly understand what the Holy Supper
is and for what Christ has instituted it, and, in
the second place, he must have a penitent heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_067">[067]</div>
<p>Such have an altogether false conception of the
Holy Supper, who regard it as a mere feast at
which a person does but commemorate Christ&rsquo;s
sufferings and death. No, the Holy Supper is
the exalted and holy mystery, in which Christ
with the consecrated bread gives us his body to
eat, and with the consecrated wine gives us his
blood to drink, even the same body which he
took on himself from the virgin Mary and gave
in death for our sins, and the same blood which
he shed upon the cross for the remission of our
sins. True, we cannot see this with our eyes,
we cannot taste it with our mouth, nor can we
understand it with our reason, but must believe
it, for our Lord and Saviour says: &ldquo;Take,
eat, this <i>is</i> my body; take, drink, this <i>is</i> my
blood.&rdquo; Our Lord and Saviour is true, and
certainly he will fulfill what he says in the
words of his testament; he is of infinite wisdom,
and knows of ways and means for the
fulfillment of his promises, even though it be
beyond our comprehension; he is almighty, with
whom nothing is impossible, who can do infinitely
more than we are able to ask or think.
If we believe with all earnestness, that it is not
mere bread and wine, but also the true body
and blood of our Saviour, who is God and man
in one person, which we receive in the Holy
Supper, then we will not be thoughtless and indifferent,
but we will approach the table of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_068">[068]</span>
Lord with devotional and humble hearts and
with the centurion exclaim: Lord, I am not
worthy that Thou shouldst come under my roof!</p>
<p>The benefits derived from the Holy Supper
are threefold: first, by a worthy partaking of
the Holy Supper we receive the forgiveness of
sin and are assured of the same. Our gracious
God has given many and manifold means to assure
the poor sinner of the forgiveness of his
sins; such means are, the preaching of the Gospel,
Holy Baptism, Absolution and the Holy
Supper. We should not ask the impertinent
question, why God has given us <i>four</i> means of
grace, instead of <i>one</i>, but rather thank him, that
he has so richly blessed us in making us partakers
of the forgiveness of our sins, and that he,
through these means, gives unto us a joyful
heart and a certain assurance that we are acceptable
unto him. Whoever knows from own experience,
how important it is for one whose
heart is terrified on account of his sins, to believe
in the forgiveness of such sins, will readily
conceive the greatness of divine mercy and care,
in not providing only one, but many means,
through which we have the assurance of the forgiveness
of our sins. Therefore, just as certain
as with your mouth you eat the body of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ which was given
for you in death for the forgiveness of your sins,
and drink that blood which was shed for the remission
<span class="pb" id="Page_069">[069]</span>
of your sins, just so certain also should
you be that such forgiveness is your portion and
inheritance. Second, the Holy Supper also confers
life. This is not a temporal, natural life,
which we have received through birth and which
is nourished through the ordinary food and
drink, but it is that new, spiritual life, which
has been regenerated through the new birth in
Holy Baptism, and which subsists by virtue of
faith in the Lord Jesus and in love to God and
our neighbor. But inasmuch as this life is yet
weak and imperfect and constant growth is
necessary, the Lord has instituted the Holy
Supper as a spiritual means of nourishment,
in order to strengthen the new spiritual life.
Luther says concerning this: The Holy Supper
is rightly regarded as food for the soul which
nourishes and strengthens the new man; for
through Baptism we are first born again, but
there still remains the old Adam in our flesh
and blood; there are so many temptations
and impediments thrown in the way by the
world and the devil, that we often grow weary
and languid and sometimes fall. Hence the
Holy Supper is given us as a daily nourishment
and food that our faith may grow and be
strengthened, and that in such contest it may
not fall back, but ever grow stronger and
stronger; for the new life must be such as always
to increase and progress; it has on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_070">[070]</span>
other hand, to suffer much; for the devil is such
a wrathful enemy, when he sees that one opposes
him and assails the old man, and he is unable to
prevail with his power, then he will sneak and
creep around on all sides, making use of all
kinds of artifice and keeps on until he finally
has made us weary, that a person either falls
from the faith altogether, or gives way to disgust
and impatience. Thereto then this comfort
is given, that the heart, when it feels the
temptations too great to bear, receives new
strength and solace from the Holy Supper.
But, thirdly, the Holy Supper also confers
eternal salvation. Just as sin, as long as it is
not forgiven, deprives us of salvation, so sin
which is forgiven opens unto us the door of
eternal salvation. Where there is forgiveness
of sin, there is also life and salvation.</p>
<p>But if we would obtain this threefold blessed
benefit from the Holy Supper, we must receive
it worthily and well prepared. This is however
not a worthiness brought about by the law, but
by the Gospel, and does not consist in a perfect
life and entire purity of the soul from sin; but
much more in this, that we are conscious of our
unworthiness and sinfulness; that we have a
heart poor in spirit and mournful, and long
heartily after the forgiveness of sin, that we also
comfort ourselves with it or wish to comfort;
that we regard our sins to be very great, but that
<span class="pb" id="Page_071">[071]</span>
we rejoice in the help which is found in none
other than the Lord Jesus Christ. On the other
hand, all those communicants are unworthy and
unfit, who in their self-righteous conceit think it
unnecessary to have the forgiveness of sin, as was
the case with the Pharisee, who stood and prayed
thus with himself: God, I thank Thee, that I am
not as other men are,&mdash;or who entirely doubt
the forgiveness of sin, as did Cain, who said unto
the Lord: My punishment is greater than I can
bear, and who will not permit himself to be delivered
from his despondent thoughts, or those
who continue in evil purpose and who knowingly
go on and serve sin, or who live in malicious
hatred against their neighbor. When
such unworthy communicants receive the Holy
Supper, it is true, they also receive the body
and blood of Christ, but they receive it unto
judgment and unto the increase of their own
damnation. Hence, too, St. Paul gives the
earnest admonition: Let a man examine himself,
and so let him eat of that bread and drink
of that cup, for whoso eateth and drinketh unworthily,
eateth and drinketh damnation to himself.
Now, whoever recognizes in himself the
above named characteristics of an unworthy
communicant, should not dare to approach the
table of the Lord in this condition; not that he
should remain away, but in the meanwhile he
should examine himself, and instead of being an
impenitent, become a penitent sinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_072">[072]</div>
<p>But are not also weak believers to be numbered
among the unworthy communicants? By
no means. But much more those who are both
weak in faith and defective in godly life, and
who are overtaken in this or that sin, and who
painfully feel their weakness and long to become
stronger, are Christ&rsquo;s right welcome
guests at his table; such the Lord does not
cast away, but much more invites to come;
for he instituted the Holy Supper especially for
the weak and infirm, that through this spiritual
nourishment they might become stronger. He
extends unto all such the gracious call: Come
unto me all ye that are weary and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest, and whosoever
comes, I will in no wise cast out.</p>

<p>Lord Jesus, I this morning rejoice that
I, with other pious Christians, am permitted
to receive Thy body and blood in,
with and under the consecrated bread and
wine. O! how my soul longs for the courts
of the Lord and for the holy altar. As the
hart panteth after the water brooks, so
panteth my soul after Thee, O my God.
For Thou art my Shepherd, I shall not
<span class="pb" id="Page_073">[073]</span>
want. O, Lord Jesus, as Thou hast begun
the good work in me a poor miserable man,
so also accomplish the same in mercy,
through the gracious power of the Holy
Spirit unto Thy name&rsquo;s glory and unto my
own welfare and eternal salvation. Dear
Redeemer, I am, it is true, not worthy that
I should come under Thy roof, but Thy
grace, which is all-sufficient, make me
worthy and amply qualify me, that the precious
food and drink of Thy true body and
blood may quicken my soul in this heavenly
feast of joy and love. Clothe me with the
garment of salvation and with the robe of
Thy righteousness by a true faith, that I
may not be found among the pretending
guests and would-be-Christians, but may be
a worthy partaker at Thy table and receive
all Thy gracious treasures which Thou hast
acquired for me. O Lord Jesus, may Thy
grace be and remain with me, as I ever put
my trust in Thee. May Thy visitation preserve
my spirit, my life and walk. And
whatever else is needful, grant Thou, O
Lord, unto me in this life and in the life
hereafter. Give me true repentance, renew
<span class="pb" id="Page_074">[074]</span>
my heart, deliver my body and soul. O
Lord! hear this my desire, and do not permit
my prayer to remain unanswered, that
I may be acceptable unto Thee in time and
in eternity. Amen, in Jesus&rsquo; name, Amen.</p>

<p>Behold me, Dear Saviour, As I Come
Relying on Thy Gracious Invitation.
May I find favor in Thine eyes, Thou Lover
of Life. For who am I that Thou shouldst
so friendly call me? Were I even holier
than the angels, yet would I not be worthy
of this repast; how then should I be worthy,
seeing that I am of impure lips, yea, an
abomination and offensive, if Thou doest
not make me worthy? Therefore come
Thou to my succor with Thy grace, and
prepare me. Thou hast said: Whosoever
cometh to me, Thou wilt in no wise cast
out. Then take my soul into Thy favor,
according to Thy great mercies. Dear
Jesus, remember that of myself I have indeed
much evil, but nothing good; so help
<span class="pb" id="Page_075">[075]</span>
me for Thy great goodness&rsquo; sake. O see
how poor and miserable I am! Remember
Thy faithfulness, O Saviour of the world,
and fill my heart with grace. O! how I
long to appear at Thy table with glowing
devotion and becoming reverence in full
faith, but where is the power to do, if I do
not receive it of Thee, thou Author and
Finisher of my faith? Therefore give Thou
unto me whatsoever is pleasing to Thee.
Graciously take from me whatsoever displeases
Thee, or cover it, at least, I most
humbly pray Thee, with the cloak of Thy
righteousness. O! blessed is the soul that
finds favor with Thee! Open Thou mine
eyes that I may behold the wonders in Thy
ordinances. Rouse my heart, and free me
of all strange thoughts, increase my hope,
inflame my desire, make ardent my devotion,
purge me of all uncleanness, and
sanctify me wholly, that I may approach
with joyful confidence, that I may receive
with pure mouth and holy heart, and with
heartfelt desire eat and drink unto the life,
welfare and blessing of my soul. Amen.</p>

<p>Alas! my Lord Jesus Christ, when I behold

great anguish didst sweat drops of blood,
as Thou wast afterwards taken prisoner,
bound, and during the whole night and hour
of darkness mocked and insulted, in the

sentenced to death, suspended on the cross,
pierced in your hands and feet with ruthless

when I see all this, I see nothing but my
sins, guilt and iniquities which brought Thee
into this plight, and for the sake of which

One must suffer the punishments of the
wicked. The Lord must atone the guilt of
the servant, and that which sinful man has
brought upon himself God must bear. O
Thou Son of the living God, how great is
Thy love and favor towards us mortals!
What hast Thou not done and suffered to
redeem me, a poor lost sinner, and to deliver
me from death and eternal damnation. I
have done evil, and Thou art punished; I
have sinned, and Thou must atone. I have
been disobedient, and Thou must for my
disobedience be overwhelmed with such anguish
and distress. Alas! Thou Lord of
Glory, what can I give Thee in return for
this Thy great goodness and faithfulness
which Thou hast shown towards me! Wherewith
shall I, poor needy mortal, requite such
unspeakable benefit? Alas! my Lord, it
shall forever remain unrequited. There is
no service in heaven or on earth whereby
to pay Thee sufficiently for it. It is Thy

pure grace and favor towards me, a poor
sinner, and that remains by me forever unrequited,
forever unmerited. And since I

righteousness, on account of our manifold
sins which we have committed against Thee,

protracted wet weather by which the land
and the fruits thereof are greatly injured.
Merciful Father, Thou who didst close the
fountains of the deep as well as the windows
of heaven at the time of the deluge, and
didst command the rain from heaven to
cease, take away from us all our sins and
transgressions, and turn away from us the
just punishment of our iniquities, the destructive
rain and great waters. For the
earth is sad, and the heavens are mourning.
<span class="pb" id="Page_084">[084]</span>
Behold the pledge in the clouds&mdash;the rainbow&mdash;and
remember Thy promise, give good
and fruitful weather, that the fruits in field
and garden may prosper, and not be destroyed
by the abundant and superfluous
rain, and thus bring upon us famine and
scarcity. Lord God of truth, Thou who
canst not lie, Thou hast said: There shall
henceforth be no more deluge to destroy the
earth. Therefore be merciful, O Lord! and
do not out of wrath close up the bowels of
Thy compassion, O do not take Thy favor
and mercy from us! Do Thou not give unto
us idle teeth, and lack of bread, bless our
bread, that we may always have something
to eat, and praise Thy holy name; thus shall
we know that we are Thy children indeed,
for whom Thou dost most faithfully care,
and praise Thee as our heavenly Father all
the days of our lives. Amen.</p>

the blessed fruits of the field, purify
the air, give fruitful rain and good weather,
<span class="pb" id="Page_085">[085]</span>
that the fruits of the land may prosper; let
them not be poisoned, so that by eating
them we together with the cattle be not
taken with pestilence, fever or other plagues;
for such plagues come when evil spirits
poison the air, and afterwards the fruits,
wine and corn, so that we by Thy infliction
eat and drink sickness and death with
our own daily bread. Therefore, dear Lord,
bless Thy gifts that they may redound to
our health and prosperity, and that we also
may not abuse them to the injury of our
souls or to greater sinfulness, intemperance
and idleness, out of which unchastity, adultery,
profanity, swearing, murder, wars and
all manner of evils flow; but give us grace
to use Thy gifts to our souls&rsquo; salvation, and
the amendment of our lives, and that the
fruits of the Land be the means of furthering
and keeping the health of our bodies

from hail and sleet, from conflagrations and
floods, and from all danger. Guard us also

done evil all the days of my life and have
not lived to Thy honor. I have fulfilled the
lusts of the flesh and have served myself
and the world more than Thee. O Lord, I
am very sorry that I have passed the few
days of my life in doing evil. I acknowledge
that Thou art only visiting my iniquities
upon me in sending this sickness. By
this Thou wouldst call me to repentance.
<span class="pb" id="Page_097">[097]</span>
O Lord, Thou judgest me righteously and
chastenest me that I may not perish with
the ungodly world. By this sickness Thou
puttest me in mind of my mortality and
teachest me to know mine end and the
measure of my days, what it is. Verily,
every man at his best state is altogether
vanity, surely every man walketh in a vain
show, he heapeth up riches and knoweth
not who shall gather them. And now,
Lord, what wait I for? Deliver me from
my transgressions. I know, Lord, that my
times are in Thy hand, Thou hast written
all my members in Thy book, which in continuance
were fashioned, when as yet there
was none of them. My substance was not
hid from Thee when I was curiously
wrought in my mother&rsquo;s womb. Since it is
Thy will that I should be sick, may I cheerfully
do this Thy will. O Lord, Thine arrows
stick fast in me, and Thy hand presseth
me sore, there is no soundness in my
flesh because of Thine anger, neither is
there any rest in my bones because of my
sins, as a heavy burden, they are too heavy
for me. O my God, preserve my soul in
<span class="pb" id="Page_098">[098]</span>
every temptation, let this bodily sickness
be a medicine for the healing of my soul.
Keep Thou my heart and mind, and through
the peace of my Lord Jesus Christ protect
me with Thy shield and buckler against all
the fiery darts of the devil. Lord, Thou
knowest it that I am the work of Thy
hands, Thou hast formed me out of the
clay; we are the clay and Thou our potter.
Alas! how I am broken in pieces! Spare
me, O Lord; Thou wilt surely not, in Thy
wrath, cast away nor break in pieces the
work of Thy hands, Thou hast separated
me from my mother&rsquo;s womb, Thou didst
make me hope, when I was upon my mother&rsquo;s
breasts. Thou art the Lord and giver
of my life, and hast power to take it again
at Thine own appointed time. Should it be
Thy will, deal kindly with me, as Thou
didst with king Hezekiah, to whose days
Thou didst add fifteen years. Behold, for
peace I have great bitterness, in love to my
soul, deliver it from the pit of corruption
and cast all my sins behind Thy back.
Should this sickness not be unto death,
then, O Lord, lift me up again and heal me,
<span class="pb" id="Page_099">[099]</span>
for I am very weak. O Lord Jesus, Thou
heavenly physician, take me under Thy
treatment, alleviate my pains and heal me
by Thy wounds, and make Thy bitter sufferings
and death my medicine. Lord, let
me touch the hem of Thy garment, that is,
Thy Word and sacraments, in which Thou
art wrapped up, and make me whole by the
virtue which cometh out of Thee. Should
it be Thy will however, that in this sickness
I shall go the way of all the earth, be it so,
for I am no better than my fathers, only
let Thy servant depart in peace, according
to Thy Word, for mine eyes have seen Thy
salvation which Thou hast prepared before
the face of all people, a light to lighten the
Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people
Israel. Amen.</p>

<p>O righteous and gracious God, I
heartily acknowledge, that I am not
only conceived and born in sin, but have
on account of human weakness in various
ways transgressed Thy holy ten commandments
in thoughts, words and actions, so
that I have not only deserved this my sickness
and other temporal affliction, but have
also deserved everlasting punishment. But
since Thy dear Son, my faithful Saviour
Jesus Christ, has made satisfaction for all
my sins, original and actual, with His precious
merits and holy blood; I beseech
Thee, that Thou wouldst for His sake be
gracious unto me, and of Thy great mercy,
forgive my temporal and eternal punishment.
Guide me by Thy Holy Spirit, that
I may separate myself from the great multitude
of the ungodly, that I may strive
after the true faith showing itself in good
works; but especially that I may be patient
under afflictions, fight a good fight, keep
the faith and a good conscience, and finally
live in Thy tabernacle forever. Do Thou
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
alleviate my bodily pains according to Thy
good will, and help me that I may bear my
afflictions, for Jesus&rsquo; sake. Amen.</p>

often and powerfully comfort Thy disciples
after Thy resurrection, and doest invite
the weary and heavy-laden to Thee,
and doest promise to comfort them: O do
Thou visit me in my sickness, comfort and
refresh me; Thou alone art my refuge, my
counsel and my help. I yearn for the evening
time of a blessed death, and long for
the joyful resurrection of my body. O let
me early experience these my requests, then
will I forever praise Thee with the Father
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>

Thee, that Thou hast revealed Thyself
to me in the writings of the holy Prophets
and Apostles, so that I can believe in Thee,
and through faith obtain everlasting life.
I beseech Thee, that Thou wouldst preserve
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
me steadfast in true faith, that I may attain
the end thereof, everlasting salvation.
Make me cheerful and ready, so that when
Thou, my dear bridegroom, doest come,
that I may meet Thee with joy; lead me to
Thy heavenly wedding-feast, where I will
love and praise Thee. Amen.</p>

<p>I thank Thee, Lord, almighty God,
that Thou hast so paternally visited and
chastised me on account of my sins. Yea,
Lord, I am glad that Thou hast humiliated
me, that I might learn Thy ways. O my
God, how often have I, like Hezekiah,
thought: Mine age is departed, and is removed
from me as a shepherd&rsquo;s tent; I have
cut off like a weaver my life; he will cut
me off with pining sickness; from day even
to night wilt Thou make an end of me.
But, my God, I see that my sickness was
not unto death, but unto the glory of God,
that Thou, my Lord Jesus Christ, mightest
thereby be glorified. For Thou hast had
mercy upon me, and hast cast all my sins
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
behind Thee, and hast prolonged my life.
I heartily thank Thee, my God, that Thou
hast revived and strengthened me, that I
can behold Thy holy temple, and attend to
my duties. Thy goodness it is, Lord, else
I should long since have perished. O, how
often will I think of Thy chastening rod,
and will fear Thee all my life and guard
against Thy wrath. Help now, O Lord my
God, that with renewed health I may also
begin a new life. Grant, that I may always
glorify Thy name, and Thy praise be
continually found in my mouth. Guide me
by Thy Holy Spirit, that I may live to Thy
honor, and not yield my members as instruments
of unrighteousness to serve sin, but
as instruments of righteousness to serve
Thee my God, that I may sing Thy hymns,
and praise and glorify Thee in Thy church.
Amen.</p>

wicked enemy. Let not my heart be terrified
at death nor despair; restrain all impatience,
make me willing to obey the Lord
my God. Help me to close my life joyfully

<div id="p65" title="1. Prayer for the Beginning of a new Church-Year.">
<h2 id="c82">1. Prayer for the Beginning of a new Church-Year.</h2>
<p>O Eternal God! faithful Father, at
the beginning of our Church-year, we,
in deepest humility, thank Thee, first of all,
for all Thy special spiritual benefits shown
us during the past Church-year. Thou hast
thus far granted unto us Thy holy Word
and its public preaching, also the use of the
holy sacraments, although on account of
our unthankfulness we have indeed deserved
that Thou shouldst have withheld such
goodness. We are indeed no better and
have not sinned against Thee less than so
many of our brethren in the faith elsewhere,
from whom Thou, through Thy just judgment,
hast either entirely or measurably
withheld the word of Thy gospel and its
public preaching; and it appears that Thou,
through Thy judgment, wouldst yet at many
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
more places take away the light of Thy
Word. O Lord! we are indeed too insignificant
for all Thy mercies, which Thou hast
hitherto shown us unworthy servants, and
that Thou doest still deal with us so sparingly.
Forgive us in mercy all our sins
by which we, whether by the neglect and
incomplete performance of good or the
committing of evil, have offended Thee
during the past Church-year. Grant this
to be our first blessing in this Church-year,
that Thou wilt with the blood of Thy dear
Son blot out all our sins of the past year,
and in order that we may be worthy of such
grace, do Thou work true repentance in all
our hearts, so that we may not bear into
the new Church-year any of our old sins unforgiven
and which we do not by Thy power
mean entirely to abandon. Preserve unto
us still further Thy holy word and sacraments
and thus the kingdom of Thy Son
among us, and do not bestow such power
upon the enemy, that will enable him to rob
us of such gifts and that the kingdom of
darkness be extended among us. In this
however, dear Father, look not upon that
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
what we are deserving, but that the honor
of Thy Son be not blasphemed by the
enemies who may imagine to have destroyed
His kingdom among us. Preserve
all our faithful teachers and ministers, whom
Thou hast given us, and bestow upon them,
at this beginning of the Church-year, new
light and strength in Thy Holy Spirit, that
they may present unto us, by Thy power
and presence, Thy Word in its purity and
simplicity without the admixture of human
wisdom; also may they at all times have
the wisdom and light rightly to conceive the
most needful things to be treated of before
their christian congregations. Permit them
therefore not to speak what they desire, but
do Thou alone rule their tongues and hearts,
that they may always speak what is pleasing
unto Thee. Give such efficacy to Thy
Word and Thy holy Sacraments, that we
may also in this Church-year experience
that they are still the blessed means of our
salvation, that they will save our souls.
Seal anew the good Thou hast already
wrought in the hearts of Thy children during
the past year, and the Word Thou hast
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
made effectual among them; and let it still
further manifest its power in teaching the
ignorant, in converting the unregenerate, in
convicting the malicious, in strengthening
the souls that already know Thee, whose
number Thou wilt also in the ways known
to Thee largely increase during this year.
Grant also unto all hearers, that they not
only receive the Word out of the mouth of
their pastors with attention and meekness,
but also at all times, whilst hearing, present
their hearts unto Thee in such stillness
and resignation, that Thy Holy Spirit may
complete the work of faith in them, and by
whose influence they may during this
Church-year lead a more holy life before
Thee than heretofore. Especially grant
Thy grace that we make Thy Word the firm
foundation of our knowledge of the truth
among us, in order that it may become a
living knowledge, which in its fruits will
praise Thee, and we indeed experience that,
to know, here by faith and there by sight,
that Thou Father art the only true God
and whom Thou hast sent is Jesus Christ,
is everlasting life. Amen.</p>

<p>O Lord of glory and God over all,
blessed forever! I heartily thank Thee
for all Thy great and inexpressible benefits,
also that Thou out of unspeakable love didst
leave Thy throne of divine glory and condescend
to us poor creatures in this vale of
tears, to release us lost and condemned sinners
from the prison of affliction. I praise
Thee, Jesus! Thou King of glory! with all
my strength and powers, that Thou didst
not appear upon earth for any other purpose
than to deliver us from the power of our
enemies, of sin, of death, hell and the
devil; to effect by Thy precious blood eternal
reconciliation between us and Thy heavenly
Father, and to regain for us, through
Thy precious merits, the lost righteousness.
Hosanna! Save now, I beseech Thee, O
Lord, Lord, I beseech Thee, send now prosperity!</p>
<p>I cast myself in deepest humility before
Thee and ask Thee with all my heart to
gladden at this time also by Thy gracious
advent Thy church which is everywhere
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
oppressed; always dwell and abide with and
among us in this land and place at all times,
and in our hearts, with Thy pure Word and
most holy Sacraments, and let goodness and
mercy come upon us. Be gracious unto us,
most beloved Saviour! and bless us, bestow
upon us temporal and eternal peace. Our
enemies however cast into the prison which
they have prepared for us, change their
counsels directed against us into foolishness,
for Thine is the kingdom and the power and
the glory forever. Hosanna! Save now, I
beseech Thee, O Lord, Lord, I beseech Thee,
send now prosperity!</p>
<p>Dear Jesus! grant unto me and all christians
Thy Spirit, that He may cleanse and
purify our hearts of all impurity and sin,
in order that Thou mayest desire to enter
in and dwell among us. Help us to receive
Thee with true faith, heartily to rejoice with
Thy spiritual Zion for Thy benefits, to follow
Thee constantly with christian patience and
humility and confidently await Thy second
coming with constant repentance and believing
hope, also at the same time serve Thee
here in the kingdom of grace with a holy
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
walk, and finally in the kingdom of glory
we shall with glorified tongues everlastingly
sing our Hosannas to Thy honor, together

<p>Merciful and eternal God, heavenly
Father! we Thy children thank Thee
from the depth of our hearts that Thou didst
so faithfully keep Thy promise and turn to us
Thy kind and paternal heart, didst send unto
us Thine only-begotten Son, the highest
Good, to be our Saviour, and to assume our
human nature, and thus didst render us acceptable
through Thy Beloved. O Lord Jesus!
Thou eternal Son of God, we honor,
praise and glorify Thee, that Thou to-day
didst become our brother and Emmanuel,
that is: God with us, didst out of unspeakable
love befriend us and clothe Thyself with
our poor flesh and blood. Thou didst in nowise
assume the nature of angels, but didst
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
honor the seed of Abraham, our human nature,
this poor earth, wretched ashes and
worthless dust even so much as to connect
Thyself personally and inseparably with the
same to all eternity. Thou wast conceived
holy and without sin, and born into this
world of a pure and chaste virgin; whereby
Thou didst sanctify and consecrate our
Adamic, sinful and impure conception and
birth, so that it may not be harmful to
us who by nature are children of wrath,
conceived in sin, and flesh born of flesh.
Thou wast born in a stable, poor and lowly;
Thou in a manger didst lie, in poverty
great, and of Thy crib, though hard, no
offence didst take, in order that Thou
couldst enrich our souls and make us lords
in Thy heavenly mansion. Thou didst
humble Thyself, in order to exalt us; Thou
didst appear upon earth, in order that we
in turn might come unto Thee in heaven.
O God, Holy Spirit! our most exalted
teacher and comforter, we to-day offer unto
Thee the sacrifices of our lips and thank
Thee with our hearts that Thou didst reveal
this exalted mystery of godliness; and as
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
the angels proclaimed it to the shepherds
and chanted it on the plain, so let it still be
preached unto us through Thy Word and
its servants. Glory be to Thee, O God the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost! in the highest,
peace on earth and good will towards men.
Help, O faithful God and father! that we
may be partakers of the new birth of Thy
dear Son, be relieved of our old sinful nature,
and be and remain new born children
of Thy grace and heirs of Thy kingdom.
My Jesus, whom I count most dear, a clean
soft bed prepare Thou here, to take within
my heart Thy rest, so shall I hold Thy
memory best. Grant, O God, Holy Spirit!
that thus our Saviour be now and forevermore
spiritually born and developed within
us. Help also, that by virtue of this birth
we may rejoice and be comforted amidst all
temptations, patiently endure and overcome
all things, and with all the angels of God
praise, honor and glorify Thee, here in time
and in heaven forever. Amen.</p>

<p>O triune God, Thus have we again
by Thy grace brought a year of our
wretched life and weary pilgrimage upon
earth to a close, and to-day in Thy name
begin another. Lord! how unspeakably
great is Thy goodness, how innumerable are
Thy benefits which Thou hast shown unto
me and mine in the past, though on account
of our sins we have deserved nothing at
Thy hands but wrath and punishment!
Thou hast graciously preserved Thy precious
Word and holy sacraments in Thy holy
congregation, peace and unity in the government,
prosperity and blessing in material
comforts, and didst richly bestow for our
enjoyment all manner of blessings for body
and soul. Thou with paternal care didst
protect Thy church from false doctrine and
persecution on account of the true faith,
our land from hostile invasion and evil contagion,
our houses and property from fire
and water, and didst by Thy care faithfully
avert from us all dire calamities. How
shall I find words to express the inestimable
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
value of these blessings? How can I according
to my obligations be sufficiently
thankful? Behold, Lord, I offer to Thee,
at the close of the old year, the fruits of
my lips, and glorify Thy grace and mercy
with all my strength and powers. My soul
must honor Thee, my spirit must praise
Thee, my mouth shall thank Thee, and all
that is within me must proclaim Thy glory.
I prostrate myself in heartfelt sorrow before
Thy feet and confess unto Thee with a penitent
heart all my sins in which I was conceived
and born, and with which I have
offended Thee during the past year, as well
as during the whole of my past life.</p>
<p>Most beloved Father! do not now reckon
such past sins to my condemnation, and do
not remember in Thy wrath my past transgressions,
but graciously forgive and forget
the same for the sake of the sufferings of
Thy dearly beloved Son. Jesus, my beloved
Saviour, be merciful to me, a poor sinner,
blot out like a cloud and mist all my transgressions
by Thy merit, cast them into the
sea of Thy innocent blood, that they may
never more come to light or before the
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
judgment of God. O God, Holy Spirit!
create within me the new man, that I may
not bring into the new year old sins and impurities,
but to-day begin a new life and
partake anew of Thy grace. Withhold from
me, O Triune God! all long and well deserved
punishment, and continue to bless
me and mine with all manner of bodily and
spiritual, temporal and eternal gifts. Let
Thy grace rest upon us anew every morning,
and renew Thy good will to all who in
this new year seek their refuge with Thee
and wait upon Thy goodness. Grant unto
us still further Thy precious Word, which
is a joy and comfort to our hearts. Enlighten
our teachers and pastors, and grant
unto their holy work the blessing of heaven;
strengthen our faithful rulers and prosper
all their good undertakings, which are pleasing
to Thee. Bless our parents, and prosper
Thou the work of their hands. Fill
our souls with true fear of God, and our

unto our bodies health, and grant
peace within our borders. Crown this year
with Thy goodness and grant unto us that
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
which is necessary to the support of life.
Protect Thy church from error in the faith
and from scandalous living, our land from
war, famine and pestilence, our homes from
consuming flames and all damage and danger,
the products of the field from hail and
tempest. Curb the wrath and fury of satan,
and send Thy heavenly hosts that they may
guard and protect us in all our ways. Convert
our enemies and check all our persecutors,
help the oppressed, provide for the
poor, feed the hungry, give drink unto the
thirsty, clothe the naked, free the innocent
captives, comfort the distressed, gladden
the sorrowing, strengthen the weak, care for
the sick, be merciful to the widows and
orphans, deliver the oppressed, guide the
traveler and accompany the dying through
death unto life.</p>
<p>Lord! teach us to act according to Thy
good pleasure, and Thy good Spirit direct
our footsteps, that we may walk before
Thee in faith, patience and hope, in godliness
and honesty, in meekness, humility
and chastity, and all Christian virtues. But
when we sin, then chastise us gently; when
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
our sins trouble us, comfort us with Thy
grace, and Thy joyful Spirit uphold us.
When satan assails us, do Thou support us,
when the world persecutes us, then protect
us; when our flesh and blood would overpower
us, then strengthen our spirit; when
we err, set us aright again. When we fall,
lift us up by Thy hand. When we become
weak and weary in our calling, refresh us.
When we are in necessity and danger, relieve
us. When we are sick and weak,
then be our physician. Should we according
to Thy will during this year depart
from hence, grant that our spirits be commended
into Thy hands. O Lord! hear;
Lord! be merciful; Lord! take heed and
grant it for Jesus&rsquo; sake. Amen.</p>

<p>Most merciful Saviour! Thou didst indeed
show Thyself to be the God of
the Jews and the Gentiles, and as the true
light that desires to enlighten all men who
come into this world unto everlasting life,
as Thou didst not only by a bright and wonderful
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
star lead unto Thyself the wise men
of the east, who were induced to honor and
worship Thee as their king, but didst also
lead us poor heathen by the enlightening
power of Thy holy Word into Thy gracious
kingdom and unto the saving knowledge
of Thee. O my Saviour! Thy faithfulness
and mercy shown unto us are so great, that
we can never sufficiently praise Thee. We
were without God strangers and excluded
from the commonwealth of Israel. But Thou
hast made us Thy people, fellow-citizens
with the saints and a household of God.
On account of our blindness we were not
enabled to know Thee and to find the way
to everlasting life; but Thou, Lord Jesus!
didst enlighten our minds and enrich us in
all knowledge. We sat in darkness and in
the shadow of death; but Thou didst let
Thy glory shine upon us, so that now we
walk in Thy light, and finally enter eternal
blessedness in heaven. For this we justly
worship and praise Thee with thankful
hearts and tongues on this holy day, and
will sing of Thy grace and goodness all the
days of our life. But we pray Thee, O
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
most faithful Saviour! with our whole soul,
that Thou wouldst so multiply Thy grace
unto us, as to preserve us and our posterity
to the end of time in a saving knowledge
of Thee, and by Thy Holy Spirit wouldst so
lead and direct us as no more to walk like
the heathen in the vanity of our minds and
our own fleshly lusts, but rather live godly
as children of light, and with humble obedience
serve Thee all our days as our King.
As Thou, most beloved Saviour, didst so
gloriously deliver us from the kingdom of
darkness and mercifully received us into
the kingdom of grace&mdash;into Thy Christian
church, grant us also to be blessed saints of
heaven, and heirs of Thine eternal glory,
for the sake and honor of Thy great name.

<p>Lord Jesus! Thou highly exalted and
beloved Son of God! I thank Thee
with all my heart, that for my good Thou
didst not only become true man, but also
for my sake didst become subject to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
law, and at Thy presentation didst participate
in the offering of purification, in order
that Thou mightest redeem me from the
curse of the law, and cleanse my soul from
its abominable impurities. I acknowledge
myself therefore under obligations also to
present myself unto Thee, and offer myself
a living and acceptable sacrifice to God.
But whilst I cannot do so of my own self,
I ask Thee, beloved Saviour, to sanctify me
by Thy innocent blood and holy Spirit, in
order that I may henceforth earnestly guard
myself against all sins, keep my body and
soul unpolluted and serve Thee during my
life in holiness and righteousness. Most beloved
Saviour! Grant, that, following the example
of the devout Simeon, I may amidst all
distress and misery of this life, in all fear and
anguish of conscience, with the arms of true
faith, embrace and press Thee to my heart,
yea, enclose Thee in my heart and never
permit Thee to depart therefrom. May
my eyes ever be directed toward Thee, O
desirable Light of the world! and behold in
Thee their only delight. Infuse into my
heart a knowledge of Thy holy will and a
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
heartfelt confidence in Thy precious merit,
and grant, that I may manifest the same
through good works before men. Banish
from my heart, O Thou Brightness of glory!
all innate darkness and evil propensities,
and may I with Simeon believe aright, live
holy and die happy. When the end of my
life draws nigh, then, O beloved Redeemer,
bear me up in Thy strong arm and merciful
hands, that satan may nevermore separate
me from Thee. Grant unto me with Simeon
a joyous departure from this world
and bestow unto me, Thy servant, such
grace that I may depart in peace, and with
all the elect behold Thee, face to face, in
eternal bliss. Amen, dear Jesus! Amen.</p>

his Son into the world. Rejoice and be

Thee with all my heart, that Thou in the
blessed womb of Thy mother Mary didst so
intimately unite Thyself with our human
nature, and in the assumed humanity didst
reconcile me with Thy heavenly Father.
Thou, my Saviour! didst humble Thyself so
deeply in order that I should be exalted;
Thou didst become the son of man in order
that I might become a child of God, Thy
brother (sister) and a beloved spouse. Thou
didst descend from Thy throne unto us, that
Thou mightest render it possible for me to
partake of Thy great glory in heaven. How
couldst Thou indeed have shown greater
love to me? Therefore, most beloved Saviour!
do I rejoice in my heart and know
truly that I stand in Thy grace, for Thou
canst not despise nor be angry with Thy
own flesh and blood. Though I am sinful
and unholy, yet do I comfort myself by
Thy holiness and innocence. Though I offended

God with sins, yet I know that Thou
art the Mediator between God and me, and
that Thou wilt appease His wrath and deliver
me from all evil, which I have to fear
on account of my misdeeds. Jesus, my
brother, although I have deserved death
and hell, Thou canst make me holy and receive
me unto eternal life. Where my flesh
and blood reigns, there I hope also to be
and remain eternally. To this help me,

so nigh unto us and unite with us in such a

Thee that Thou doest so heartily receive
our souls unto Thyself and freest them
from all transgression and threatening condemnation;

Thy Holy Supper a memorial of Thy wonderful

Thou didst enter into the heaven of glory in

We, however, are still pilgrims here below,

heaven, into Thy glory, where we can remain

Mediator at the right hand of Majesty in
heaven, in order to save us eternally and to
make us happy in Thy kingdom. Be Thou
therefore mindful of us even when we forget
ourselves, and save us mightily, and
make us happy, not for our sake, but for
Thy sake. For the kingdom which we
shall inherit, is Thine; Thine is the power
to lead us into it; and Thine shall be all
the honor and glory forever, when we, as
Thy rescued children, shall be happy in
Thy kingdom. Amen. Hear us for the sake

Gospel, into which the angels desire to look.
Work true repentance in our hearts, that
the angels in heaven may rejoice over us.
Kindle in us fervent prayer and praise of
Thy name, that we may perform an angel&rsquo;s
office and sing with them: Holy, Holy,
Holy, Lord God of Sabaoth. And finally
let also our souls be carried by angels into

<p>Lord Jesus Christ, who didst come into
the world to call sinners to repentance
and to enlighten all men unto life eternal,
we praise Thee with our whole heart, and
extol Thy great goodness and mercy, that
Thou didst not only enter into this place
and into this church and congregation with
Thy divine Word and holy Sacraments, and
didst purge out the leaven of papistic doctrine
and idolatry, but that Thou hast also
redeemed us poor sinners from the kingdom
of darkness, hast called us into the light of
Thy holy Gospel, and hast transplanted us
into Thy kingdom of grace.</p>
<p>O Lord Jesus, we are not worthy of all
Thy goodness and faithfulness, yet we pray
Thee with humble hearts, that Thou wouldst
continue among us Thy grace, with Thy divine
Word and holy Sacraments, that Thy
holy name may be known by us, that it
alone may be feared and honored by us, and
we all may live, and serve Thee, according
to Thy divine pleasure. And what we have
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
done amiss against Thee and Thy holy
Word, by not having been obedient to the
Gospel, do Thou, Lord Jesus Christ, graciously
pardon, and do not on account of our
sin take from us this saving treasure, but
preserve it unadulterated unto us and unto
our posterity. Yea, Lord Jesus, preserve
unto us Thy Word, for it is the joy and
comfort of our hearts.</p>
<p>Guard and defend us and Thy whole
Christian, especially Thy Evangelical Lutheran,
Church against all error, unbelief,
and the pernicious doctrine of others. Restrain
all enemies, persecutors and blasphemers,
and be Thou our refuge, our
strength, our shield and buckler, that the
gates of hell may not prevail against us.
Especially do we beseech Thee, O Lord our
Saviour, that Thou wouldst enter into the
house of our heart, that Thou wouldst enlighten
us by Thy Holy Spirit, purify our
hearts and graciously grant, that we may
walk worthy of the Gospel, and remain
steadfast in the truth once known and confessed,
unto our end. O Lord Jesus, let
our souls obtain Thy salvation, that we may
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
be saved through Thee and in Thy kingdom
behold Thee and Thy great glory forever
and ever. Amen, Lord Jesus, Amen.</p>

<p>O give thanks unto the Lord; for
He is good: because His mercy and
truth endure forever. Let Israel now say,
that His mercy endureth forever. Let the
house of Aaron now say, that His mercy
endureth forever. Let them now that fear
the Lord say, that His mercy endureth forever.
O, how we feared the destruction of
the precious grain in the fields! O, how
we took thought and troubled ourselves,
lest the bread which God has yet given us
in these hard times might be snatched away
before our eyes and out of our hands! But
it is of the Lord&rsquo;s mercies that we are not
consumed, because His compassions fail not;
they are new every morning. Now all, to
God give thanks, who has everywhere done
marvelous things, who has preserved us
alive from our birth, and has done countless
favors. May He grant us a joyful heart,
and in these times continual peace in Israel,
and that His grace remain always with us,
and uphold us, as long as we live. O God,
give peace to Thy land, prosperity and salvation
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
to every estate. Lord God, heavenly
Father, who dost create holy courage, good
counsel and good works, give to Thy servants
peace, which the world cannot give, so
that our hearts may cling to Thy commandment,
and that we may, by Thy protection,
live through our days quietly and securely
against our enemies, through Jesus Christ,
Thy dear Son, our Lord. Amen.</p>
<p>And now, O God, we know and confess
with grateful hearts, that Thou hast given
us the early and the latter rain in due
season, and hast faithfully and annually
protected our harvests. Thou hast watered
our ridges abundantly: Thou hast settled
our furrows: Thou makest it soft with showers:
Thou blessest the springing thereof.
Thou hast prospered our grain, and tilled
our land. Thanks, praise, glory and honor
be unto God the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, as it was in the beginning, is now,
and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>
<p>We also pray Thee, O our God and Father,
from the depth of our hearts, that
Thou wouldst give unto us all Thy Holy
Spirit, so that we may receive with thanksgiving
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
what Thou bestowest upon us, and
may sanctify it with Thy Word and prayer,
that it may be employed and used to Thy
glory and for our temporal support, for the
benefit of churches and schools, and of our
needy neighbor, and that thereby the shameful
and hurtful worship of mammon may be
most diligently avoided. Protect this place
and also the entire country against war and
danger, against dangerous and hostile invasion
and destruction. Give to our government
the spirit of wisdom, of counsel, of
power and strength. Confirm and preserve
peace among us. Let us pass the days of
our earthly life in true knowledge of Thy
holy name and in Thy fear, also in health,
peace and union, and finally grant to us all
everlasting salvation, for the sake of Jesus
Christ, our Lord and Saviour. Amen.</p>

<p>Almighty God, Thou who created
the world and all that is therein, and
hast made of one blood all nations of men
for to dwell on the face of the earth: Thou
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
who art not far from every one of us; for
in Thee we live and move and have our being:
Thou, who in times past didst suffer the
gentiles to walk in their own ways, but now
commandest all men everywhere to repent
and with Thy grace doest visit their hearts.</p>
<p>Lift up the light of Thy countenance
upon us, that Thy salvation may everywhere
abound, and the glory of Thy name
extend itself unto the ends of the earth.
Look down from Thy height upon the misery
of so many nations, who yet sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, who are ignorant
of their divine origin, and lie under
the cruel tyranny of satan. The Light,
which lighteth every man that cometh into
the world, hath not yet risen upon them.
They walk in the vanity of their minds.
Their reason is clouded because of great
darkness. They are estranged from the
life that is of God, through the ignorance
that is in them and through the blindness
of their heart. The god of this world hath
blinded their understanding, and the common
enemy of souls has taken them captive
according to his will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>Grant, merciful God, that by the misfortune
of others we may realize our own
blessedness, and bewail the lamentable state
of blindness, with which Thou hast smitten
the gentiles, and worthily apply the greater
light so graciously presented unto us to so
much the greater holiness. O do Thou
finally suffer the light of the Gospel to rise
unto those, who are yet far from Christ,
the true Sun, and who have hitherto altogether
groped in thick darkness of idolatry.
Through the loving voice of the
Gospel, bring back these scattered sheep
into Thy spiritual fold. Grant such shepherds,
who will not rule vigorously and
harshly over the sheep, nor devour their
substance and clothe themselves with their
wool; but who, in the spirit of love and
gentleness will wait upon the weak, heal
the sick, bind up the wounded, bring back
the erring, seek the lost, and in walk and
life present themselves a living example to
the gentiles. And inasmuch as the word
of the Gospel, concerning the love of God
as revealed in Christ, is the only means to
reconcile man with God, and to gather the
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
erring sheep into the fold of Christ, do Thou
grant, that all who go forth to proclaim the
Gospel unto the heathen, may, with divine
wisdom, make known the word of reconciliation,
with boldness overcome all hindrances,
and disregarding all selfish motives
in the discharge of so holy an office, may
seek nought but the glory of Thy name, and
the extension of the kingdom of heaven.
Grant, that they themselves may plainly
know and acknowledge the mystery of the
cross, as the central point of Evangelical
doctrine, may not pretend to know anything
among the gentiles, save Christ Jesus and
Him crucified, and worthily extol Him to
others as the only hope of glory and fountain
of salvation, through our Lord Jesus
Christ, the great Shepherd and Bishop of
our souls. Amen.</p>

<h3>(Thanksgiving.)</h3>
<p>Lord God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
Thou art the almighty God of heaven
and earth, and in Thee we live, move, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
have our being. Thou, however, doest desire
that man should live by bread, and therefore
didst, in the beginning of the world,
make the earth fruitful through Thy almighty
Word, and after the days of the
flood, didst declare that while the earth remaineth
seed-time and harvest shall not
cease. Behold, Lord, this Thy order, once
established, continueth yet, and Thou still
doest ever crown the year with Thy goodness.
Thou doest cause grass to grow for
the cattle and herb for the service of man.
Thus Thou bringest bread out of the earth
and doest fill our hearts with joy and gladness.
Most loving God, how wisely indeed
hast Thou ordered all things! How great
is Thy goodness toward us, who are not
worthy of Thy bread. And how wonderfully
infinite Thy omnipotence, when Thou
doest increase the little grain which moulders
in the earth, into a hundredfold! It
is Thy unsearchable wisdom, this Thine unutterable
goodness, mercy and omnipotence,
which hath again this year visited our land.
Men had sowed their seed in hope, but Thou
hast hitherto blessed the seed in the fields,
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
and hast moreover permitted us to live to
the time, when men everywhere reap and
gather into barns what Thou hast given.
O Lord, Thou God of riches, all that men
harvest is indeed Thine; for we of ourselves
can bring forth nothing out of the earth, and
be it little or much, it is still more than we
have merited. Thanks be also unto Thy
holy name for each and every gift, which
Thou hast bestowed on our fields during this
year. Thou alone art the God, who doest
sustain us from the day of our birth, and
shower Thy blessings upon us. Wherefore
unto Thee alone be all the praise, honor and
thanksgiving now and in eternity.</p>
</div>
<div id="p85b" title="(Petition.)">
<h3>(Petition.)</h3>
<p>We beseech Thee, O kind Father, that
Thou wouldst not again take from us in Thy
wrath, what Thou in Thy grace hast given.
Thou Thyself hast said in Thy Word, that
rain is not seemly in harvest. So do Thou
not permit that the blessings of the fields,
which Thou hast hitherto spread out before
our eyes, may perish by unfavorable
weather. Do Thou also henceforth guard
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
that which has been gathered into barns
and garners, against danger by fire and
water, against thieves and unfaithful stewards,
against usurers and unscrupulous grain-speculators,
and against all else that might
rob us, or destroy Thy gifts. Moreover let
us not forget that all we receive comes from
Thee and is Thine. Do Thou likewise help
that because of this we may never be discontented
with what Thou givest, never
uselessly squander aught of it through luxury
and wantonness, never lock up any of
Thy gifts unmercifully against our needy
neighbor through avarice or envy; nor in
mistrust against Thee brood over it with
cares, as though that which Thou hast
given be not sufficient for our wants. Inasmuch
as we in future will have need of
Thy providing care, do Thou not in Thy
wrath let our land remain uncultivated, lest
it lie waste and become unfruitful when forsaken.
Prevent every thing which might
hinder the tilling of the fields after harvest.
And, that no years may come, in which
man sows but does not reap, do Thou provide
that neither frost nor heat, neither
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
floods nor drought, nor destructive insects
destroy the seed in the earth by which we
in future are to live.</p>
</div>
<div id="p85c" title="(Prayer.)">
<h3>(Prayer.)</h3>
<p>Be Thou with us, O gracious loving
Father, and preserve unto us our daily
bread, which Thou during the present harvest
doest everywhere distribute. Above all
grant favorable weather and constant sunshine,
that the ripening grain may all fully
mature, so that which yet remains in the
fields may be stored away in good condition.
Bless that which has been gathered into
barns, that it may be prepared for our daily
use, increase it while passing through our
hands in preparing it, may it be blessed to
our nourishment; grant us life and health,
peace and quietude, to enjoy all that Thou
hast given in such a manner, that it may
not only give strength to the body, but also
be good and wholesome to the soul, so that
Thy temporal blessing may thus in manifold
ways redound to our welfare. When Thou
hast heard these our petitions and prayers,
then remind us also of our obligations, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
grant that we acknowledge all our substance
to be the gift of Thy goodness, that we
heartily thank Thee for it, savingly use it,
serve our bodies with it, as is meet, willingly
impart of it to others, and finally devote
and use all we have received of Thee alone
unto Thy honor. Do Thou continue in future
to bless our land with Thy gracious
visitation, improve and enrich it with great
fertility. Give warmth to the dust of the
earth. Refresh the fields with fruitful showers,
water their furrows, moisten the plowed
ground, and do Thou prosper the grain to
be sown therein, that the land may continue
to yield forth its increase, the valleys be
covered with corn, so that we may shout for
joy and sing Thy praise forevermore.</p>
</div>
<div id="p85d" title="(Intercession.)">
<h3>(Intercession.)</h3>
<p>Yea, Thou art God, Who Daily Openest
Thy liberal hand and satisfiest the desire
of every living thing. Therefore do Thou
during this season of harvest provide for all
people, and let every one receive his proportion
of food. Remind each one of his
duties, that the indolent may not sleep in
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
time of harvest and neglect the necessary
interests of himself and his household.
But do Thou likewise grant strength to
those, who in the sweat of their face gather
their daily bread; refresh them when they
are weary, and permit each one with his
household to enjoy in good health what his
fields have produced, that we all may be
truly glad because of Thy benefits. But do
Thou also help that the rich may not depend
upon their barn bursting with plenty, and
thereby forget that their souls may be taken
from them unawares, and another obtain
possession of that which they have gathered.
Remember the poor, who have nothing to
harvest. Grant that others may help gather
also for them, and do Thou thyself recompense
those who permit them to glean ears
in their fields, or who impart unto them of
their abundance. In short, where there is
but little, do Thou bless the small supply,
that it may be sufficient for the wants to
whom it is given, and where Thou hast given
a large supply, do Thou so control it, that it
may not be abused unto evil. Preserve tranquility
and peace in all lands, that strangers
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
come not unto us and devour our harvests.
Do Thou everywhere guard against failures,
hard times and famine. And do Thou also
ward off from us everything which might
render it difficult for us to obtain the necessary
things for the support of temporal life.
On the other hand, do Thou permit every
one to enjoy what Thou hast allotted to him,
that rich and poor alike may acknowledge
and praise Thee for evermore. Finally, O
Thou Saviour of all men, we ourselves are
the spiritual stewards in Thy church, and
Thou art the Lord of the harvest; we therefore
pray Thee to send laborers into Thy
harvest, and let Thy harvest among men
likewise become great in all places. Grant
that good seed may everywhere be sown,
and pure doctrine be preached among all
christians. Protect the world against the
tares, which the devil is busy in scattering
forth. Convert those who sow in unrighteousness
and reap in sorrow, or sow unto
the flesh and of the flesh reap destruction.
Sanctify us all together, that we may be of
one mind in Christ, and may sow unto the
spirit, and of the spirit once reap eternal
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
life. Yea, when once the entire world shall
be sufficiently ripe for the last harvest, then
grant that we all, as pure wheat, may be
bound into sheaves and gathered into Thy
garners, and be preserved in heaven unto
eternal joys. There shall we as those whom
Thou hast promised, reap without ceasing
what we have sown here, and rejoice as they
that rejoice in harvest, with unspeakable
joy. Hear us, O God, and grant us all
what we ask, for the sake of Thy dear Son,
Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
